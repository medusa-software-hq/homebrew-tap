    # java_version pins the launcher to the openjdk@21 we depend on and build against.
    # Without it, write_jar_script defaults to "any JDK" — so the declared dependency was
    # installed but never used, and the CLI ran on whatever JDK happened to be newest
    # (or on JAVA_HOME). That is how a user ended up running it on JDK 24, where Netty's
    # sun.misc.Unsafe calls print four JEP 498 deprecation warnings over the CLI's output.
